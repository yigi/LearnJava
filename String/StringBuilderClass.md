## Java StringBuilder:
 
StringBuilder append(X x): This method appends the string representation of the X type argument to the sequence.
 
StringBuilder appendCodePoint(int codePoint): This method appends the string representation of the codePoint argument to this sequence.
 
int capacity(): This method returns the current capacity.
 
char charAt(int index): This method returns the char value in this sequence at the specified index.
 
IntStream chars(): This method returns a stream of int zero-extending the char values from this sequence.
 
int codePointAt(int index): This method returns the character (Unicode code point) at the specified index.
 
int codePointBefore(int index): This method returns the character (Unicode code point) before the specified index.
 
int codePointCount(int beginIndex, int endIndex): This method returns the number of Unicode code points in the specified text range of this sequence.
 
IntStream codePoints(): This method returns a stream of code point values from this sequence.
 
StringBuilder delete(int start, int end): This method removes the characters in a substring of this sequence.
 
StringBuilder deleteCharAt(int index): This method removes the char at the specified position in this sequence.
 
void ensureCapacity(int minimumCapacity): This method ensures that the capacity is at least equal to the specified minimum.
 
void getChars(int srcBegin, int srcEnd, char[] dst, int dstBegin): This method characters are copied from this sequence into the destination character array dst.
 
int indexOf(): This method returns the index within this string of the first occurrence of the specified substring.
 
StringBuilder insert(int offset, boolean b): This method inserts the string representation of the booalternatelean argument into this sequence.
 
StringBuilder insert(): This method inserts the string representation of the char argument into this sequence.
 
int lastIndexOf(): This method returns the index within this string of the last occurrence of the specified substring.
 
int length(): This method returns the length (character count).
 
int offsetByCodePoints(int index, int codePointOffset): This method returns the index within this sequence that is offset from the given index by codePointOffset code points.
 
StringBuilder replace(int start, int end, String str): This method replaces the characters in a substring of this sequence with characters in the specified String.
 
StringBuilder reverse(): This method causes this character sequence to be replaced by the reverse of the sequence.
 
void setCharAt(int index, char ch): In this method, the character at the specified index is set to ch.
 
void setLength(int newLength): This method sets the length of the character sequence.
 
CharSequence subSequence(int start, int end): This method returns a new character sequence that is a subsequence of this sequence.
 
String substring(): This method returns a new String that contains a subsequence of characters currently contained in this character sequence.
 
String toString(): This method returns a string representing the data in this sequence.
 
void trimToSize(): This method attempts to reduce storage used for the character sequence. 


```Java
String sql = "Insert Into Users (name, age)";
sql += " values ('" + user.getName();
sql += "', '" + user.getage();
sql += "')";

//The above-mentioned code could be written using StringBuilder like this,

StringBuilder sqlSb = new StringBuilder("Insert Into Users (name, age)");
sqlSb.append(" values ('").append(user.getName());
sqlSb.append("', '").append(user.getage());
sqlSb.append("')");
String sqlSb = sqlSb.toString();
```
